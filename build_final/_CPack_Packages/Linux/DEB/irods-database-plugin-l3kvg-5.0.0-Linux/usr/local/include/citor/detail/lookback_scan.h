/// `flag` for one tile does not invalidate a neighbour's flag line. The
/// state machine is:
///
///   `Initialized` -> `AggregateAvailable` -> `PrefixAvailable`
///
/// A tile's worker:
///   1. Reads `d.in[tile_lo..tile_hi]`, computes local total and writes
///      the chunk-local inclusive scan into `d.out[tile_lo..tile_hi]`.
///   2. Release-stores `aggregate` and lifts `flag` to
///      `AggregateAvailable`.
///   3. Walks predecessors, summing `aggregate`s, until it finds a
///      predecessor in `PrefixAvailable` (acquire). That predecessor's
///      `prefix` plus the accumulated aggregates is this tile's prefix.
///   4. Release-stores `prefix` and lifts `flag` to `PrefixAvailable`.
///   5. Adds `prefix` in place over `d.out[tile_lo..tile_hi]`.
///
/// Tile 0 is special: its prefix is `identity`, so it can skip the
/// lookback walk entirely and proceed straight from step 2 to step 4.
