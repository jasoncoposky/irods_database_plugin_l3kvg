// Lock-free single-owner / multi-stealer work-stealing deque.
//
// Implements the Le / Pop / Cohen / Nardelli formulation (PPoPP 2013) of the
// Chase / Lev deque with explicit C++20 memory orders. The deque has a single
// owner thread that performs `push` and `pop` on the bottom; any number of
// stealer threads concurrently call `steal` at the top. The owner never
// resizes during a steal: growth happens only on the owner's `push` hot path
// when the underlying ring buffer is full.
//
// Memory-order summary (verbatim from Le 2013 figure 1):
//   - push: relaxed-load `bottom`, relaxed-load `top`, optional grow,
//     relaxed array store, release-store new `bottom`.
//   - pop: relaxed-store `bottom = bottom - 1`, seq_cst fence, relaxed-load
//     `top`, relaxed array load. On size 0 (empty) the owner restores
//     `bottom`. On size 1 the owner CAS-tightens `top` (seq_cst success,
//     relaxed failure) to settle the steal race.
//   - steal: acquire-load `top`, seq_cst fence, acquire-load `bottom`. If
//     empty, abandon. If non-empty, acquire-load array slot, then CAS `top`
//     (seq_cst success, relaxed failure). The `top` CAS is what serializes
//     against a concurrent `pop` on the last item.
//
// The internal buffer is a power-of-two `Array` indexed modulo capacity.
// Growth allocates a new `Array`, copies the live elements (those between
// `top` and `bottom`), and links the old array via a freelist that is only
// reaped at deque destruction time. A stealer holding a pointer into the old
// array remains valid for the rest of its current steal attempt because the
// freelist never frees mid-flight (Le 2013 section 3 footnote 2).
//
// Termination: at deque destruction, every owned `Array` (including any
// superseded ones pinned by an outstanding stealer) is freed via
// `reapAllArrays`. The owner is responsible for draining all in-flight steals
// before destroying the deque; the synchronous primitive that owns the deque
// joins on every worker before the deque goes out of scope.

    // of locked stack frames in cache; the n/participants cap ensures
    // there are at least `participants` tiles. Hardware-agnostic:
    // works on any CPU that exposes index2/size in sysfs; falls back
    // to 64 KiB when sysfs is absent.
    // Tile sizing -- balance two competing constraints:
    //   (a) Chain parallelism: in a single coherence cluster, the
    //       lookback chain serializes the workers (tile T waits on
    //       T-1's prefix). If `numTiles > participants`, some workers
    //       grab a second tile and must then wait for the chain to
    //       progress past the first wave, defeating parallelism. So
    //       prefer `numTiles ~= participants_per_cluster` so each
    //       cluster's chain length matches its worker count.
    //   (b) L2 residency: Pass-1 writes d.out chunk-local-scan (one
    //       cache pass) and Pass-2 in-place adds the global prefix
    //       (second pass over the same lines). Each worker's per-tile
    //       working set is `2 * tileBytes` (the tile's d.out lines
    //       are read+written twice). If this exceeds L2, Pass-2's
    //       reads spill to L3, costing bandwidth.
    //
    // Resolve: pick `tileBytes = clamp(perParticipantBytes, kMinTileBytes,
    // l2KibPerCore*1024)`. The L2 cap ensures the tile's working set is
    // L2-resident; the per-participant ratio ensures the chain length

//     bounded (per-test fixtures, comparative benchmark cells, library

// of one CCD (or shared-L3 cluster). Arenas have disjoint workers and no
// cross-arena stealing.

// participating in any `Arena` pool MUST NOT submit synchronous work to a
// different `Arena` pool; that would block the worker on a queue its own

// `shouldFallThroughCrossArena()` and runs the work inline on the caller when
// the rule would be violated. The cross-arena call still produces correct
// results, but does not parallelize on the target arena.
