/// recursive child spawned during their bodies) has retired. The producer
/// participates as slot 0 and steals from other workers' deques when its own
/// drains.

/// Cancellation: the supplied `CancellationToken` is observed at task-boundary
/// chunks. A stopped token causes participants to stop spawning fresh recursive
/// children and to drain the outstanding task count without admitting more
/// work; the join still rendezvous with every worker before returning.
///
/// Exception handling: if any task body throws, the first exception is captured
/// and rethrown from the producer after every outstanding task has retired.
/// Subsequent throws drop. The remaining tasks are cancelled (the cancellation
/// flag is set as part of the throw response) so the join does not block on
/// quiescence.
///
/// The `HintsT` policy carries the `StealPolicy` choice that the engine
/// uses to bias victim selection: `StealPolicy::ClusterLocal` prefers
/// same-CCD victims, mirroring the topology's shared-L3 grouping.
/// `StealPolicy::Global` falls back to a uniform xorshift random victim
/// probe.
