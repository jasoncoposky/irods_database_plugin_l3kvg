///
/// The 64-bit `generation` carries both flags and a monotonic phase counter.
/// Bits 0 (shutdown) and 1 (cancel) are reserved; the producer increments by 4
/// per published job so the high 62 bits act as the ABA-free phase counter. A
/// 32-bit phase would be at risk of wrapping under sustained dispatch; 64 bits
/// is overkill but free given the cache-line padding.
///
/// The `futexWord` is parking-only: workers re-check `generation` after every
/// wait return, so spurious or duplicated wakes are correctness-neutral.
/// Updates use `relaxed` atomics; the happens-before chain runs through
/// `generation` (release) instead.
