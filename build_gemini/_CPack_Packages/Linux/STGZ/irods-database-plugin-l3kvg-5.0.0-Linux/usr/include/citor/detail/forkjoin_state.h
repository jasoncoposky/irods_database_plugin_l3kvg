/// Stack-resident shared state for one in-flight `citor::ThreadPool::forkJoin`
/// call.
///
/// The producer constructs a `ForkJoinState` on its stack, populates the
/// immutable shape, and publishes a non-owning pointer to every participating
/// worker via the worker-loop dispatch descriptor. Workers consume tasks from
/// their own Chase-Lev deque, falling back to victim stealing when their deque
/// drains. The producer participates as slot 0 and joins on the `pendingTasks`
/// countdown reaching zero.
///
/// Layout invariants:
/// - `pendingTasks` lives on its own line; it is the single contended atomic on
/// the dispatch
///   completion path. Workers `fetch_sub(1)` on it after retiring a task so the
///   producer's spin-then-park loop can detect zero without reading any
///   per-worker slot.
/// - `forkJoinCancelled` lives on its own line so cancellation broadcast does
/// not interfere with
///   the per-task hot path. Workers acquire-read this flag at task-boundary
///   chunks; a stopped token causes any victim probe to stop emitting fresh
///   task descriptors.
/// - `firstException` is on its own line; the CAS-from-null path is cold.
///
/// Padding-suppression note: the layout keeps every contended atomic on its own
/// `kCacheLine`-sized line, so the analyser's "excessive padding" warning is
/// the design trade-off we want -- false-sharing avoidance over byte-tight
/// packing.
// Lower store-queue stalls under recursive spawn:
// libfork's per-call frame is 36-40 B on a single cache line, no internal
// alignas padding. citor's prior layout (4 alignas(kCacheLine=128)-separated
// blocks) issued 3-4 separate Read-For-Ownership transactions per recursive
// forkJoin -- one per cold cache line touched. Collapsing the contended atomics
// onto a single line cuts per-call RFOs from 3-4 to 1. False-sharing on the
// no-cancel/no-throw common path is moot: peer writes to
// `cancelled`/`firstException` only fire on the cold cancel or throw paths, so
// the producer's hot `pendingTasks` poll keeps the line stable.
