/// call. The trailing per-worker `done` slots are NOT owned by `ChainState`:
/// the pool pre-allocates a contiguous `ChainDoneSlot` block once at
/// construction time (sized `participants()`), and every chain call borrows
/// that block via `doneSlots`. Each call reserves a fresh interval in the
/// pool's monotonically-advancing epoch counter (see `epochBase`) instead of
/// zero-resetting the slots, with no `operator new` / `operator delete` on the
/// dispatch hot path.
///
/// The Global rendezvous is fully decentralized: every slot (including slot 0)
/// stamps `done[slot] = s + 1` (release) after running stage `s`, and every
/// slot's pre-stage barrier is an independent scan over `done[w] >= s + 1` for
/// every other slot `w`. No participant acts as a serial gate; the wait loops
/// execute in parallel across all workers. The cancellation handshake
/// is encoded by stamping `done = nStages` on the cancelled slot's line, which
/// satisfies any active stage's wait condition unconditionally and lets the
/// spin loop drop a per-iteration `chainCancelled` poll.
