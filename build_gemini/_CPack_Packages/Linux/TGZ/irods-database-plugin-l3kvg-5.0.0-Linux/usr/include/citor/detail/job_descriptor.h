/// A `JobDescriptor` lives on the producer's stack for the duration of one
/// synchronous primitive call. The producer fills it before publishing the new
/// generation; workers read it via the acquire-load on `PoolControl::activeJob`
/// after observing the matching generation. The descriptor is single-writer
/// (producer fills, then publishes), many-reader (workers consume).
///
/// Layout:
/// - The first cache line holds the immutable descriptor body (range bounds,
/// chunk shape,
///   participants, balance / priority, body / token). Workers acquire-load
///   these once after observing the matching generation.
/// - The contended atomics (`nextBlock`, `firstException`, `exceptionWorkerId`)
/// sit on dedicated
///   `kCacheLine`-sized lines so concurrent dynamic-counter increments and
///   exception CAS attempts do not invalidate the immutable body.
///
/// The descriptor's `body` is a `FunctionRef` pointing into a closure that
/// lives on the producer's stack. Because every primitive in v1 is synchronous
/// (the producer joins before returning), the closure outlives the descriptor
/// by construction.
///
/// The padding overhead trades several hundred bytes of stack against
/// MESI cache-coherency traffic on the contended atomics, which is the dominant
/// hot-path cost.
